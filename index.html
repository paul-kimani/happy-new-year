                <div class="love-letter">
                    <h3>My Dearest Maureen,</h3>
                    <p>Out of the uncountable universe of feelings that exists inside me, I daunt to select, even the smallest part, describing my feelings towards you. It seems that  each word that I type barely has touch on the sheer feeling of love, happiness and appreciation that I am so grateful to have and as such for the upcoming letters I will attempt to express what my heart feels. You turn my world upside down which is why I dare say that you complete me. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
                    <p>From your body language, the flame in your eyes, the tone of your guffaw, and the affectionate temperature of your palms, I fathom a language my spirit comprehends before the waking part of me. With you, there is always some sort of enchantment surrounding me that seems to fit perfectly wherever it is that I was missing. Our love in every second, every word breathed, every pause and every silence have shown a true love that is pure. While others look for love in grandiose displays, I‚Äôve found it in our simplest moments: the manner in which our fingers fit perfectly together, those moments when words are unnecessary and finally the sound of your heartbeat harmonizing to that of mine.</p>
                    <p>Life is a rainbow where there are shades of colors and curves that turn up and down, but you have been my steadfast companion. Where our difficulties have cast darkness upon our lives, you have been either a source of strength or of comfort when I needed light. Who knows what kept it, our friendship, unwaivered when everything else in between seemed to fail? Here our bond grew even stronger, glowing from within and infinitely deep. Have you ever recalled such days when everything does not exist but each other? Or the moments when our looks in each other eyes were more expressive than that thousand words? These, these are the shards of time, that are embedded into my soul, these moments I am so grateful for ‚Äì the love that we had (and still have)‚Äì the love that has never gone away ‚Äì the love that endures. In the sanctuary of your embrace I am at ease everyday. The confusion, the noise, all disappears and we are left here in solace enveloped by a love that looks as vast as the universe. With you I‚Äôve discovered what it is like to really love and be loved ‚Äì not just in passion and fervor, but in the stillness of long-suffering, in the gentle kindness, and in a selfless sacrificial act. The emotion you‚Äôve painted to me is not a simple comer of feeling or infatuation but a lifelong process of exploration. I promise to be with you through thick and thin for everything that has happened and is still to happen in the future. To be the one you turn to in times of strength and adventure as well as in shortages and storms. How much I love you can‚Äôt be compared to the ocean, for its length (if it had one)longer than the sky, and longer than the life of the universe. The varieties of the stage, the vast cast of characters, and the infinite number of scenes still sit me down with a measure of thanks that we crossed paths. For in finding you, I‚Äôve found the most ‚Äòreal‚Äô and ‚Äòromantic‚Äô means to convey love. For ever will we hold our relationship dear and I look forward to our stories in the coming days.</p>
					<p>As we continue this beautiful journey together, know that my love for you will only grow stronger with each passing day. I am so lucky to call you mine, Maureen. Thank you for being the light of my life.</p>
                    <p>With all my heart,</p>
                    <p>Your devoted lover,</p>
					<p>Your's forever,</p>
					<p>Your baby, your carorina, your everything</p>
